## Assignment 1

In this programming assignment, you will start from a compiler that we
(mostly) provide based on one from class. You will add binary arithmetic
operators and a few built-in Python functions.

Starter code is here:

[https://github.com/ucsd-cse231-s22/pa1](https://github.com/ucsd-cse231-s22/pa1)

In the _office hours sessions_ for week 1 (see calendar on [homepage](/)), we
will run tutorials for doing much of the needed work for this assignment.
Seriously, go and you'll see how much we've tutorialized this assignment for
you! These sessions will also be recorded.

### Problem Specification

The grammar of the language your compiler will support is:

```
program := <stmt> ...
stmt := <name> = <expr>
      | <expr>
expr := <number>
      | <name>
      | <expr> <op> <expr>         (you!)
      | <builtin1>(<expr>)
      | <builtin2>(<expr>, <expr>) (you!)
op   := + | - | *                  (you!)
builtin1 := print | abs            (you! [abs])
builtin2 := max | min | pow        (you!)
number := 32-bit integer literals
```

You can see this (mostly) reflected in the `ast.ts`, with `parser.ts`
converting from a parse tree representation to the AST representation. Then
code generation for several of them is implemented for you in `compiler.ts`.
You will need to add the cases corresponding to binary operators and the new
builtins, which are labeled with `(you!)` in the grammar above.

Your task will be to make it so input programs using the binary operators,
and the builtin functions listed above, have the following behavior:

- `+`, `-`, and `*` should use the corresponding WASM operators `i32.add`,
`i32.sub`, and `i32.mul` on the two operands after evaluating them
- `abs` should produce the absolute value of its argument
- `max`/`min`/`pow` should take two arguments and produce the larger of the
numbers, the smaller of the numbers, and the first number raised to the
other's power, respectively

Your implementation is up to you, but a likely approach is:

- Add expressions for binary operators and builtin2 to `ast.ts`
- Add parsing support for these expressions in `parser.ts`
- Add code generation for these expressions in `compiler.ts`
- Add TypeScript functions to implement the new builtins as necessary (use
`print` as a guide)
- Test this as you go by adding tests in the tests/ directory
- Watch your program work in the browser by opening build/index.html in a
browser of your choice.

We recommend implementing these features one at a time (don't try to do
multiple new kinds of expressions at once), so that you can test more
incrementally.

### Testing

We use the [Mocha test framework](https://mochajs.org/) along with 
[Chai assertion library](https://www.chaijs.com/) to simplify testing the 
compiler. We provide some starter testing code in `tests/parser.test.ts` and 
`tests/runner.test.ts`. We included comments in these files to get you started
testing the compiler and we added to-dos where we expect additional tests.
We encourage you to test other parts of the compiler individually if you
find yourself stuck, like `compile`.

A few specific cases have specific errors we will test for:

1. If the program doesn't parse correctly, make sure the error has
`ParseError` as a substring of the thrown message
2. If the program uses a name that isn't defined, make sure the error has
`ReferenceError` as a substring of the thrown message
3. If the program divides by zero, the error can be whatever WASM's runtime does
when dividing by zero

To throw specific errors, `throw new Error(" message here ...")` suffices (this
uses the built-in `Error` class in JavaScript/TypeScript). If you want to make
specialized exception classes, go for it! We will make refinements like this in
future assignments.

### Building and Running

To get started, make sure you have NodeJS installed
[https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and check
out this repository. In the repository, run

```
npm install
```

This will download and install the necessary WASM and Typescript dependencies.

You can build `index.html` by running:

```
npm run build-web
```

And then open the created file in `build/index.html` in a browser to get the
textbox and run button for your code.

You can run test suits using the following command, and it will print a summary
of passing and failing tests:

```
npm test
```

### Writeup

In a file called `README.txt`, answer the following questions:

1. Give three examples of Python programs that use binary operators and/or
builtins from this PA, but have different behavior than your compiler. For
each, write:
  - a sentence about why that is
  - a sentence about what you might do to extend the compiler to support it
2. What resources did you find most helpful in completing the assignment?
3. Who (if anyone) in the class did you work with on the assignment? (See
collaboration below)

### Collaboration

You can discuss your approach and code with anyone in the class, make study
groups to work together, have public discussions on the course message board,
and so on. Make sure to give credit to collaborators in your README (see
below) and make an individual submission. This assignment is predominantly
_for your learning and practice_. Other assignments in the course will be
completed on your own and/or with additional assessment and have more
restrictive collaboration policies.

### Submission

You can submit your code to the `pa1` assignment on Gradescope.

### Grading

Most of your grade on this assignment comes simply from the autograded
component – we want to make sure you have everything built successfully. A
note that future assignments will not necessarily follow this scheme.

- 90% Autograder Tests
- 10% Written Responses

Another note about stakes while discussing credit – this class's material is
necessarily _cumulative_. That means that the next assignment will build on this
one, not just conceptually but concretely in terms of code. As a result:

- It's important that you understand this one!
- There will be another opportunity to demonstrate that you understood this one
on the next assignment!  So if you're worried that you've done poorly on the
assignment, don't assume your grade is forever ruined, there will be
opportunities to regain credit for this. Focus on learning.
