There are several components to the course:

- **Lectures**
- **Quizzes**
- **Assignments** (first half of the course)
- **Projects** (second half of the course)

## Lectures

The course has lecture each Tuesday and Thursday in Center 214, 20 total. Some
attendance and participation is required – **you have to come to 8 lectures
in-person, and participate, to pass the course**. There are a few reasons for
this policy and this particular number:

1. Without _any_ incentive, it's too easy to decide that attending isn't worth
the effort of commuting, putting on shoes, etc, and that you can learn just as
well by watching the podcast after the fact or participating remotely. I don't
believe this is uniformly true, and I want people to at least get exposed to the
value of being part of an in-person community.

2. Lectures will be designed for you to engage and discuss with your classmates
via [peer instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_instruction) and other
active learning methods. Research shows convincing evidence that these are
effective ways to learn!

3. I don't want you or us to have to do complex logistics around you being sick,
traveling for a conference or interview, etc. Also, being physically present is
an investment of time, and a lot of us are living somewhat hybrid lives still.
It will take some time to adjust back to in-person activities. I want to respect
that, and I also want to respect the choices of students who feel they learn
best remotely.

    As a result, I settled on 8 and I am **firm** on this requirement. This is
    the only policy for extenuating circumstances, travel, sickness, etc.
    Please plan to attend more than 8 so that you give yourself a fair amount of
    slack, and front-load your attendance as much as possible to avoid later
    surprises. You might even find that you like coming to class!

Mechanically, this means that you'll need an iClicker to click into live quiz
questions that happen during class, which is how we'll gauge participation. You
don't have to get the questions right! There will be app options that you can
use on a mobile device instead of purchasing a clicker, but these are subject to
WiFi connectivity and not always supported. We highly recommend that you get an
iClicker at the UCSD Bookstore to bring to class.

Each lecture will also be streamed over Zoom and recorded. There will be course
staff both in the room physically and on a live chat to answer questions and
facilitate discussions during lecture. Attending on Zoom **does not** count
towards 8 required attendances.

## Weekly Quizzes

Each week there will be a _lecture quiz_ that reviews the content from the
previous week. These will be due on _Friday evening_. They will be administered
on Gradescope. You can submit as many times as you like and will get immediate
feedback on the correctness of your answers.

The quizzes will reference the readings given each week, as well as content from
lectures. They may also involve downloading and running code to get expected
output from a program or other nontrivial tasks, so leave some time for them.

## Assignments

For the first 4-5 weeks of the course, we will have a few _programming
assignments_. These will involve you writing a compiler according to some
specification that we provide, and submitting on Gradescope. You'll get a mix of
automated and manual feedback from us.

The assignments are, roughly:

1. Basic Compiler (variables and arithmetic)
2. Functions Compiler (functions, conditionals, primitive datatypes)
3. Peer Code Review of Functions Compiler
4. Objects Compiler (classes)

## Projects

For the last 5-6 weeks of the course, you'll work on _projects_. More about
these will be announced as they get closer, but:

- You'll work in groups, and we'll give you some choice in who you work
with, so keep that in mind as you meet folks in the class.
- You will have an _individual_ assessment related to the project where you'll
do some addition to the project independent of your group members. This
constitutes your **final exam/comprehensive assessment** for the course, and
will be a mix of a report/code and an oral exam.
- The projects will involve large-scale collaboration, potentially _across
groups_, to build an interesting and more full-featured compiler.
- There will be several checkpoints to keep you on track and give feedback on
your project progress.

## Grades

We will turn your scores from the above items into a letter grade.

- You have to do all the quizzes, and eventually get all the questions right on
all but one, to get an A. You can work on them after the deadlines to get to
this point. If you have more than one quiz where you don't eventually get all
the answers right, your grade is capped at a B. Think of this as 10-15% of your
grade.
- Class participation doesn't count towards your grade, but you have to come to
8 classes (as described above) to pass the class.
- The assignments in the first half of the class are graded holistically, and
excellent performance on later assignments can make up for missed credit on
earlier ones. Think of this as around 25-30% of your grade. Rubrics for individual
assignments will be included on those assignments.
- Your team has to participate in the project and do quality work for each
milestone to get an A; individual milestones will have clear rubrics. Think of
the group project part as another roughly 30% of your grade.
- Your individual assessment at the end of the quarter is how you demonstrate to
us that you've understood the work your group has done, and that you've
generally mastered the material in the course. Think of this as the remaining
30% of your grade.

You have to complete all of the assignments, the project, and the individual
assessment to pass the course (don't skip any). In general, always submit
something on time; don't try to submit work late. Trust that the next assignment
in sequence will have structure for recovering.
